<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet AMD</li><li>Dry AMD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is categorized into two main types: Wet AMD and Dry AMD. Dry AMD is the more common form, characterized by the gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells in the macula, leading to slow vision loss. Wet AMD, although less prevalent, is more severe and involves abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina, causing rapid and severe vision impairment. Both types contribute significantly to the AMD market, driven by increasing prevalence and the demand for effective treatments and management options.</p></p>
