<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rupture Disc Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Arch Rupture Disc</li><li>Anti-arch Rupture Disc</li><li>Flat Type Rupture Disc</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rupture discs are used in pressure relief systems to protect equipment from overpressure situations. Positive arch rupture discs are domed in shape and deflect outward when pressure exceeds a certain level, allowing the disc to rupture. Anti-arch rupture discs are designed with a reverse curvature to prevent dome formation, offering improved reliability. Flat type rupture discs have a flat design and rupture evenly across the disc surface. Other market types may include pre-scored rupture discs or composite discs with multiple layers for added protection. Each type offers unique benefits for different applications.</p></p>
