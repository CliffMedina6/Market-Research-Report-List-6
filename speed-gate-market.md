<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Speed Gate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Movement</li><li>Double Movement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Movement Speed Gates are those that open and close in a single motion, typically sliding to the side to allow one person to pass through at a time. These gates are efficient for controlling the flow of pedestrian traffic in areas with low to moderate foot traffic. </p><p>On the other hand, Double Movement Speed Gates are designed to open and close in two motions, creating a larger opening that accommodates two people passing through side by side. This is ideal for areas with high foot traffic where faster entry and exit is required.</p></p>
