<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alpha Blockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-selective Antagonists</li><li>Selective Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alpha blockers are medications used to treat conditions like high blood pressure and enlarged prostate by relaxing blood vessels and muscles in the body. There are two main types of alpha blockers: non-selective antagonists and selective antagonists. Non-selective antagonists block both alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors, leading to a broader range of effects. Selective antagonists target only alpha-1 receptors, providing more specific treatment and potentially fewer side effects. Both types of alpha blockers play a crucial role in managing various medical conditions.</p></p>
