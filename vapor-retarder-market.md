<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapor Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Less than 0.1 Perm</li><li>0.1 Perm-1.0 Perm</li><li>1.0 Perm-10 Perm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vapor retarders are classified based on their permeability, measured in perms. Materials with less than 0.1 perms are considered extremely low permeability and are most effective at blocking moisture. Those in the range of 0.1-1.0 perms offer moderate resistance to vapor transmission. Vapor retarders with permeability in the range of 1.0-10 perms are considered high permeability and allow for greater moisture transfer. Understanding these categories helps builders and homeowners select the most appropriate vapor retarder for their specific needs.</p></p>
