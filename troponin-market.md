<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Troponin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Troponin I (TnI)</li><li>Troponin T (TnT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Troponin I (TnI) and Troponin T (TnT) are biomarkers used in the diagnosis of heart attacks and other cardiac conditions. Troponin I is specific to heart muscle, while Troponin T is found both in the heart and in skeletal muscle. The Troponin I market is driven by its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting cardiac damage. Troponin T, on the other hand, has a longer half-life in the bloodstream, allowing for a longer detection window. Both biomarkers play a crucial role in the early diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases.</p></p>
