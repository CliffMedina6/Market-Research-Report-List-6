<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agriculture tires market is primarily divided into two types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial agriculture tires feature steel belts and a flexible sidewall, providing superior traction, improved fuel efficiency, and enhanced durability, making them ideal for high-speed applications and rough terrains. In contrast, bias agriculture tires consist of layers of fabric that crisscross, offering robust support and stability at lower speeds, which is suitable for traditional farming methods and less demanding terrain conditions.</p></p>
