<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HPLC Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversed-Phase</li><li>Normal-Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HPLC columns are used for separating and analyzing compounds in a sample. Two common types of HPLC columns are reversed-phase and normal-phase columns. Reversed-phase columns utilize a nonpolar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase, making them ideal for separating compounds based on hydrophobicity. In contrast, normal-phase columns use a polar stationary phase and a nonpolar mobile phase for separating compounds based on polarity. Each type of column has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific compounds being analyzed.</p></p>
