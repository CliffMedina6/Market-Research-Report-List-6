<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reverse Osmosis (RO) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage RO system</li><li>Double-stage RO system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reverse Osmosis (RO) Systems come in two main types: Single-stage and Double-stage. Single-stage RO systems utilize a single membrane to remove contaminants from water, making them more affordable and simpler to install. On the other hand, Double-stage RO systems use two membranes to provide even cleaner and purer water, making them ideal for areas with higher levels of contamination. Both types of systems are effective in removing impurities from water, but Double-stage systems offer a higher level of purification.</p></p>
