<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire-Resistant Hydraulic Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HFA</li><li>HFB</li><li>HFC</li><li>HFD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant hydraulic fluids are classified into four main types: HFA, HFB, HFC, and HFD. HFA fluids are water-based with high water content, offering good lubricating properties. HFB fluids are also water-based but have a higher proportion of water, making them less flammable. HFC fluids are water-free, using water glycol as a base. HFD fluids are synthetic fluids with high flash points, providing excellent fire resistance. Each type has specific characteristics and is used in different applications based on their properties.</p></p>
