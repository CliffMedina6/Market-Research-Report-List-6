<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminals</li><li>Regasification Terminals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small Scale LNG terminals can be categorized into two main types: Liquefaction Terminals and Regasification Terminals. Liquefaction Terminals are facilities that convert natural gas into LNG by cooling it to a liquid state for storage and transportation. On the other hand, Regasification Terminals are facilities that convert LNG back into gaseous form for distribution and consumption. Both types of terminals play a crucial role in the LNG supply chain, enabling the transportation and utilization of natural gas in remote or isolated areas.</p></p>
