<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Thickness Measurement System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical Thickness Measurement Systems are categorized into two types: Contact and Non-Contact markets. Contact measurement systems involve physical contact between the sensor probe and the material being measured, providing accurate measurements but risking damage to delicate surfaces. Non-contact systems, on the other hand, utilize optical technology to measure thickness without touching the material, allowing for non-destructive testing and ensuring the safety of fragile materials. Each system has its own advantages and is utilized in different industries based on their specific requirements.</p></p>
